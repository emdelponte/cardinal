# Cardinal temperatures for fungi and oomycetes

Code for an interactive dashboard (made using R + flexdashboard + DT + plotly) that displays the data on the “cardinal temperatures” - minimum (Tmin), optimum (Topt) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures of five life-cycle processes (disease development, fructification, infection , spore germination and sporulation ), as well as growth in culture which were extracted for fungi and oomycete species. 

The data are available online at: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.tqjq2bvw6.
